/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
